DESCRIPTION: This course examines the development of Church History from the post- apostolic period through to the rise of Islam in the mid-seventh century. Close attention will be given to the lives and principal writings of the most significant Christian leaders and theologians, to the development of the institutional church and to its complex relationship with the state, to the outbreak of various heresies and to the church’s response to heresy, and to the historical context in which these important events occurred.

LEARNING OUTCOMES: Students who complete CH500 will demonstrate the following: (1) A basic knowledge of the history and theology of the church during the early period; (2) A basic competence in interpreting this history and theology, and an ability to evaluate these issues and their historical development; and (3) A critical and sympathetic appreciation for the breadth, unity, and diversity of the Christian church.

COURSE FORMAT:  This course will be conducted online on a ten-week schedule aligned with Fuller’s academic calendar for a total of 40 instructional hours, which will be outlined in the Assignments and Assessment section below. Students are required to interact with the material, with each other, and with the instructor regularly through online discussions, reading, and other assignments that promote active learning.

A typical week’s work in this course will include: (i) Completion of the Required Reading; (ii) Viewing the week’s required video lecture; (iii) Participating in online discussion forums. During weeks three and seven submission of a short paper will be due. A midterm will be completed during week five. During Final’s Week submission of a final exam and an analytical essay will be due.

COURSE GRADING SCHEME:

GRADEMARKDESCRIPTIONA94-100Outstanding: The level of research, thinking, and communication are outstanding. You critically evaluate the relevant theories, integrate it in the analysis of your selected topic or case, and show how it is applicable in the context you have chosen. Additionally, you synthesize models to create new understandings and/or theory. This is NOT a common grade.A-90-93Superior: The level of research, thinking, and communication are superior. You understand and interact with the theories, integrate it with


your topic, and have shown how it is applicable in the context you have chosen.B+87-89Very Good: The level of research, thinking, and communication are very good. You appear to understand the theories, read the assigned literature, and have made progress in showing how it is applicable in the context you have chosen, though your work could be stronger in both areas.B84-86Satisfactory: The level of research, thinking, and communication are satisfactory. You appear to have read the assigned literature and have made progress in showing how it is applicable in the context you have chosen, though your work could be stronger in both areas.B-80-83Acceptable but average at best: The level of research, thinking, and communication are acceptable. It appears you understand the reading and have made a start in showing how it is applicable in the context you have chosen.C+77-79Acceptable but definitely below average: The level of research, thinking, and communication are barely acceptable. You have read some of the theories and have started to consider how it is applicable in the context you have chosen, but you have not demonstrated either clearly.C74-76Borderline pass: The level of research, thinking, and communication are borderline. The demonstration of your critical thinking is absent, but the narrative may merit some consideration.C-70-73Not acceptable: Depending on what I see, I may assume you tried, but it is not graduate level. The only reason it received a passing grade is that you submitted it for consideration with some evidence of work done.F69 or below
COURSE AND SEMINARY POLICIES:

Students are responsible to view Fuller’s Course Policies on the Canvas Course Page (regarding Fuller’s statements on Academic Integrity, Nondiscriminatory Language, Accommodation Services, Attendance/Participation, Recording Notice, Pass/Fail Registrations, Incompletes, Statement of Informed Consent, Student Handbook, Writing Center, Netiquette, and Canvas use). Additional information on course policies follows:

Late Assignments
All assignments must be turned in by the date indicated (for specific due dates, see the Course Schedule below). Discussion posts submitted late will receive a 20% grade reduction per day late. Essays submitted late will receive a 10% grade reduction per day late. In the case of a true emergency, however, contact the professor as soon as possible to discuss assignments. No penalty will be applied if a student requests and is granted an extension before the due date.



Incompletes and Holds
For information pertaining to incompletes and holds, see the Student Handbook. Incompletes for master’s level courses may be requested by talking directly with the professor. Specific criteria must be met before an incomplete can be granted.

Nondiscriminatory Language Statement
“We recognize that “man,” “men,” and “mankind” are unacceptable as generic terms. Such exclusive language, though once normative in our speaking and writing, alienates a substantial group of people and causes harm, even when harm is inflicted unconsciously and without intention. As Christians who support human equality, we seek to avoid exclusive language, which expresses or encourages discrimination within the church or society. We expect faculty, students, staff members, and administrators/managers to use language that includes women and men of all races and ethnicities in all our teaching, writing, witness, and worship and the use of nondiscriminatory language, in general.”
(see Fuller’s Course Policies).

Academic Integrity
“Each student is required to complete the online tutorial, You Quote It, You Note It. Completing this tutorial one time meets this requirement for all courses, both online and in classrooms.
Students are also expected to review and understand the commitments to academic integrity as printed in the Student Handbook and the Seminary catalog. Some infractions can be addressed by personal confrontation and corrective counsel. The following violations of these commitments will be firmly addressed formally:

? Submitting the same work in whole or in part in more than one course, or for the same course, without the permission of the professor(s);
? Submitting as one’s own work material (s) obtained from another source;
? Plagiarism: unattributed quotations or paraphrases of ideas from published, unpublished or electronic sources;
? Unauthorized collaboration in preparing assignments;
? Cheating on exams by any means;
? Aiding another student on papers and tests in violation of these commitments.

“Any of these violations will result in a failing grade on the assignment and possibly in the course, and will be reported to the Academic Integrity Committee which may impose further sanctions in accordance with the Academic Integrity Policy. Evidence of repeated violations will result in a formal disciplinary process. (For the full statement on Academic Integrity see The Student Handbook under Official Statements.) You may contact the Academic Integrity Committee Chair at aic-chair@fuller.edu” (see Fuller’s Course Policies for further details).

Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
In this class, the use of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT is not permitted. Using AI without permission constitutes a violation of Fuller’s policy on Academic Integrity.
