COURSE DESCRIPTION
ST506 Systematic Theology: Creation, Church, and Consummation is a survey of systematic (doctrinal or constructive) theology that focuses on the doctrines of the creation, providence and divine action, theological anthropology, church and her mission, and eschatology.  In keeping with systematic theology's nature as an integrative discipline, the course considers carefully biblical, historical, philosophical, and contemporary theological materials, with a special focus on global, contextual, and diversity issues. Throughout, interdisciplinary connections are pursued and investigated (even beyond theological disciplines) with a special focus on theology-science engagement. The implications of the trinitarian faith to current issues such as liberation, justice, equality, gender, environment, and religious plurality be carefully discussed with the ultimate goal of helping the students learn to practice “embodied” theological thinking for the sake of the diverse ministry settings in the Global Church.
The following doctrines will be discussed.   
1) Creation and Providence: Christian trinitarian theology of creation in tradition and contemporary theology; cosmic evolution, science, and creation; providence and divine action; theodicy and suffering; the suffering (“pollution”) and  flourishing of nature
2) Theological Anthropology: the evolution of humanity; imago dei ; the nature of human nature (in relation to neurosciences and the philosophy of mind); race, gender, sexuality, family, and human flourishing; the doctrine of sin and Fall in tradition and contemporary theology
3) Church: the kingdom of God and the church; the problem of supersessionism; mission and ministry (incl. ministers and ordination/ commissioning of men and women); sacraments/ordinances; liturgy and worship; the governance of the community; the unity of the church
4) Consummation: Human Eschatology:  death; bodily resurrection; judgment; religious ends (heaven, hell, universalism, annihilationism); Cosmic Eschatology: millennium; Second coming, final consummation, new creation. 


LEARNING OUTCOMES
Students who complete Systematic Theology 2 will demonstrate: (1) a basic competence in interpreting historic and more recent perorations of Christian beliefs in creation, humanity, church, and eschatology; including the main debates; (2) an ability to critically and constructively evaluate these theological doctrines and ideas; (3) a critical and sympathetic appreciation for the breadth, unity, and diversity of the theologies of the worldwide Christian church; (4) a capacity to exercise embodied theological reflection that shows how trinitarian faith forms us for engaging practically with diverse real-life, pastoral, and ministerial settings in the pluralistic world of ours (the ultimate goal of all theology courses).

COURSE FORMAT
This is a fully online asynchronous course.

1. 1, 150 pages of required reading.  [This assignment is related to learning outcomes 1,2, 3] 


2. Weekly video lessons with embedded PowerPoint presentations. [This assignment is related to learning outcomes 1,2, 3, 4] 

3. Weekly Forum Postings and Responses. [This assignment is related to learning outcomes 2, 4] 

The purpose of the FORUM Postings and Responses is to process the assigned academic materials, both readings and video presentations, and give the student an opportunity to practice theological argumentation and reflection with the ultimate goal of learning to think theologically for the sake of the diverse ministry settings. The initial Posting is due Thursday midnight and its length is around 250 words. Similarly, the Response to at least two other fellow students’ Postings, due by Sunday midnight, should be 250 words -- in two parts, each about 125 words (in other words, these are two separate responses, each about 125 words).

Note that the initial Posting cannot be turned in after Thursday midnight and Response(s) can neither be posted before Thursday midnight (as that would not make it possible for you to review other students' postings). Missing the deadline will automatically lead into the loss of points.

The Grading Rubric for FORUM submissions will consider the following two aspects:
* that the posting draws from both lectures and mini-lecture(s) and
* that it includes not only exposition (a mere summary of the content) but also critical engagement: comparison and contrasting, raising questions, analyzing and defining concepts, etc.

It is very important to know that the FORUM submissions are to be academic in nature, based on a careful study of the assigned materials, rather than personal sharing (although a brief personal sharing, when relevant, is permitted in case it is a part of academic discussion!).


4. Quiz to assess the mastery of basic concepts, issues, and theological figures.  [This assignment is related to learning outcomes 1, 2] 

At the end of the course, there is a Quiz to assess the mastery of basic concepts, issues, and theological figures. The format of the Quiz is multiple-choice questions and does not require the student to produce text, merely to recognize the correct answer.  The questions will be drawn from the pool of concepts, issues, and theological figures listed on The Quiz Preparation Sheet (Appendix # 1).

The length of the Quiz is 30 minutes. It can be taken only during the designated time frame, neither earlier nor later. No resources can be used during the time of taking the quiz (i.e., it is a closed-book exam).


5. Two 1,000-word critical response essays on readings  [This assignment is related to learning outcomes 2, 3, 4] 

The two 1,000-word Critical Reading Reviews are the following: 
* Review # 1: CHOOSE ONE from the Category below titled “(Re)sources for Major Topics of the Course,” a special study on creation, theological anthropology, ecclesiology, or eschatology:  max. 250pp. After detailing the choice of the reading, reflect on the ways it has helped you challenge and enrich your theological understanding of the chosen topic and the ways it may also relate to your own faith and ministry context. Where possible, make also connections to the rest of the relevant course materials studied elsewhere in the course.
* Review #2:”Women in the Church and Ministry.” Drawing from Buck, Reframing the House, Kärkkäinen, An Introduction to Ecclesiology, ch. 11, and a number of other relevant portions of integrative, global, and contextual readings and lectures, reflect on the ways they have helped challenge and enrich your understanding of the role and status of women in church and ministry.  

The expectation is that the student not only summarize the main content and arguments of the readings but also  engage them critically. The grading rubric will consider the nature and accuracy of both the summary (40%) and critical engagement (60). 

The length of these Critical Reviews is 1,000 words each. While there are no particular formatting rules, proper language and grammar as well as the neatness of the paper is being taken into consideration. No footnotes are necessary, merely an in-text reference to a direct citation. The full bibliographic information of the chosen text should be placed on top of the paper.


6. A research essay on an assigned topic [2,500-300 words; 10 pages] [This assignment is related to learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, 4] 

The research essay provides an opportunity to examine a particular topic or question which is of particular importance or concern to the student.  Its main purpose is to help develop research skills, logical thinking, and particularly theological argumentation and reasoning, as well as academic writing skills. The topic, to be approved by the professor, should relate to a vital issue or problem facing the global church, drawing from the diverse historical traditions. 

The length of the essay is about 2500-3000 words (10 pages double-spaced).
With regard to the contents and the development of argumentation, the essay should not only contain exposition (explanation) but also critical comments and discussion, as well as, ideally,  some tentative constructive ideas.  Normally, there is a thesis (main argument)  to be developed and defended with the help of relevant exposition and critical commenting.  

The aim of the essay should be clearly presented in the introduction of the paper and the essay should end with a set of conclusions.  Main sections should be titled (headings and/or subheadings). 
With regard to format and style (e.g., footnoting), the student should follow Kate L. Turabian, A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, rev. by John Grossman and Alice Bennett (Chicago: Chicago University Press, 6th ed. 1996 and subsequent editions). No separate bibliography is needed when theology format is followed (i.e., complete bibliographical references are given in footnotes).  An excellent free online resource that gives you details of all formatting and style needs, plus valuable information about research and writing in general, is https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/turabian/citation-guide.html .

Students of SOPMFT are permitted to use the social science format, although the traditional humanities format is preferred. When bibliography is included, it should contain only works referenced to in the paper.

Further guidance with regard to the selection of the topic, searching for (re-)sources, and preparation of the Research Paper will be provided throughout the course. The Grading Rubric as well as some further Guidelines can be found in Appendix #2 below.

Suggested topics for the essay are the following:1
1) Attempt an Evangelical doctrine of creation for today in critical dialogue with other views.
2) Attempt an Evangelical doctrine of the image of God for today in critical dialogue with other views.
3) Examine contemporary Roman Catholic doctrine of the church or ministry from an Evangelical perspective.
4) Assess the major strengths and liabilities of a chosen Liberationist or another “contextual” view of the church or ministry.
5) Assess the major strengths and liabilities of a chosen African, Asian, or Latin American theologian’s views of the church or ministry.
6) Engage critically and sympathetically the theology of human person in any North American “contextual” perspective or in any global perspective.
7) Discuss critically a specific question or problem related to the doctrine of creation or theological anthropology or eschatology in the teaching of any contemporary theologian (the choice of theologians to be approved by the instructor).
8) Compare and contrast any two contemporary theologians’ eschatologies with regard to a specific issue or a focus (the choice of theologians to be approved by the instructor).
9) Offer a critical analysis of the understanding of creation in American Process Theology.
10) Examine arguments for and against universalism.
11) Offer an examination of a particular issue in either the sacrament/ordinance of Water Baptism or Eucharist/Lord’ Supper.
12) Examine a specific topic related to ministry in a “contextual” (e.g., Feminist or Womanist) or “global” (e.g., African or Asian) perspective.
13) Examine and engage critically the “theology” of the Muslim ummah from a hospitable Christian perspective. 
14) The student may also select another topic of his/her own choice: Especially recommended are those that have contextual/intercultural implications. The topic should be confirmed by Dr. Kärkkäinen before beginning the work.

COURSE AND SEMINARY POLICIES

Students are responsible to view Fuller’s Course Policies on the Canvas Course Page (regarding Fuller’s statements on Academic Integrity, Nondiscriminatory Language, Accommodation Services, Attendance/Participation, Recording Notice, Pass/Fail Registrations, Incompletes, Statement of Informed Consent, Student Handbook, Writing Center, Netiquette, and Canvas use). Additional information on course policies follows:

Late Assignments
The failure to submit weekly forum posts and responses to other students by due date automatically results in the loss of all points for that assignment. No grace periods.

The failure to submit the 1,000-word critical response paper on time results in initial deduction of points by 50% and thereafter, 10 more percent each beginning new day.

Ten-page research paper, due by the end of the quarter, on Friday midnight (PST) of the 11th week cannot be submitted late. According to Fuller rules, the instructor is not allowed to receive any course work beyond the end of the quarter. The failure to submit that or any other assignment due by the end of the quarter automatically results in loss of all points.

The quizzes can be taken only during the designated time frame, neither earlier nor later. No resources can be used during the time of taking the quiz (i.e., it is a closed-book exam).

Incompletes and Holds
For information pertaining to incompletes and holds, see the Student Handbook. Incompletes for master’s level courses may be requested by talking directly with the professor. Specific criteria must be met before an incomplete can be granted.

Nondiscriminatory Language Statement
“We recognize that “man,” “men,” and “mankind” are unacceptable as generic terms. Such exclusive language, though once normative in our speaking and writing, alienates a substantial group of people and causes harm, even when harm is inflicted unconsciously and without intention. As Christians who support human equality, we seek to avoid exclusive language, which expresses or encourages discrimination within the church or society. We expect faculty, students, staff members, and administrators/managers to use language that includes women and men of all races and ethnicities in all our teaching, writing, witness, and worship and the use of nondiscriminatory language, in general.”
(see Fuller’s Course Policies).

Academic Integrity
“Each student is required to complete the online tutorial, You Quote It, You Note It. Completing this tutorial one time meets this requirement for all courses, both online and in classrooms. Students are also expected to review and understand the commitments to academic integrity as printed in the Seminary catalog. Some infractions can be addressed by personal confrontation and corrective counsel. The following violations of these commitments will be firmly addressed formally:
? Submitting the same work in whole or in part in more than one course, or for the same course, without the permission of the professor(s);
? Submitting as one’s own work material (s) obtained from another source;
? Plagiarism:  unattributed quotations or paraphrases of ideas from published, unpublished or electronic sources;
? Unauthorized collaboration in preparing assignments;
? Cheating on exams by any means;
? Aiding another student on papers and tests in violation of these commitments.

“Any of these violations will result in a failing grade on the assignment and possibly in the course, and will be reported to the Academic Integrity Committee which may impose further sanctions in accordance with the Academic Integrity Policy.  Evidence of repeated violations will result in a formal disciplinary process.  (For the full statement on Academic Integrity see The Student Handbook under Official Statements.)  You may contact the Academic Integrity Committee Chair at aic-chair@fuller.edu” (see Fuller’s Course Policies for further details).

APPENDIX 2.
Further Theological Research Essay Guidelines
Systematic Theology /Dr. Veli-Matti Kärkkäinen

* Be limited, be focused! The most common weakness of student papers is the failure to limit the scope of inquiry, thus making it too wide. 
* Attempt an in-depth investigation of a limited topic, rather than a wide survey of opinions or views. 
o While in your reading and studying for the topic you may be exposed to number of different (historical and contemporary) views or theologians, in a research essay you need to go beyond a survey to analysis, comparison, and drawing of conclusions.
* While the number of sources consulted is not an issue (i.e., there is no absolute rule as to how many references you need to have), it is clear that no research essay can be written without proper sources.
o Especially if you write an essay focusing on the thought or theology of one specific theologian, be sure to include some other voices, critical or affirmative, to make it a dialogue rather than a “book report”.
* “MUST-HAVES”
o A title on a separate title page.
o A clear purpose-statement indicating what is the goal of your inquiry. 
o In addition to a clearly defined purpose statement, have a thesis-statement (your main argument).  Thesis is a concise statement in the indicative voice located in the introduction of your paper. It summarizes what specifically is the claim you are making by submitting your essay – your position/opinion you argue for in the remainder of your essay. 
o A statement concerning the importance and significance of the study.
o An explicit layout or plan of your discussion in which you tell the reader how you are going to structure your discussion and what are its main parts (like “First...Second...” or similar).
o A clear outline with subheadings. You should break your discussion into smaller units, each of them having a subheading. There is no need for a Contents-page for this short paper. 
o A proper conclusion in which you pull together the results of the inquiry, assess their meaning, point to some practical implications (where relevant), or indicate tasks for further research.
* If English is not your first language (or otherwise you feel the need), be sure to have the text checked by a native speaker.
* FORMATTING HELPS 
o Text 12 point, footnotes 10 point.
o Book titles and non-English terms in italics. E.g. theopneustos (no quotation marks).
o Do not underline any words. The text is to look like a printed book.
o Do not use bold fonts except for headlines.
o Include page numbers on the top right-hand side.
o Quotations: If shorter than three lines, include in the main text in citation marks. If longer, make a separate indented single-spaced paragraph  with no citation marks.

IN SUM: After introduction in which you present the purpose, thesis, and plan of the paper, offer the main discussion in which you both exposit (explain) the main points of your topic and engage in a critical dialogue and argumentation with differing views/opinions, to be followed by conclusion.

            1 Note that these suggestions are fairly general in nature and should be limited and specified by the student. To give two specific examples: 1) Should you wish to study Moltmann’s eschatology (#3 above), you have to choose a specific question/problem/theme such as his view of millennium or universalism; in no case should you attempt a general survey of Moltmann’s eschatology.  2) Concerning the doctrine of universalism (#11), you have to specify what kind of universalism you are talking about (as there are number of such views) and then delve into an in-depth analytic (and or comparative) investigation.
         2 CNP stands for “Contextual” North American Perspectives, category 3. under Required Reading. You CHOOSE from TWO categories (about 200 pp.) assigned sections. It means that for some weeks you may not have any sections assigned, depending on your choices.
         3 This section is a summary of ch. 6 in Kärkkäinen, Creation and Humanity and is not required reading. Rather, for the beginning student in theology, it might be helpful to get an overview—a “bird’s eye view”—before delving into many details, some of which are quite technical.
         4 This section is a summary of ch. 7 in Kärkkäinen, Creation and Humanity and is not required reading. Rather, for the beginning student in theology, it might be helpful to get an overview—a “bird’s eye view”—before delving into many details, some of which are quite technical.
         5 This section is a summary of ch. 10 in Kärkkäinen, Creation and Humanity and is not required reading. Rather, for the beginning student in theology, it might be helpful to get an overview—a “bird’s eye view”—before delving into many details, some of which are quite technical.
